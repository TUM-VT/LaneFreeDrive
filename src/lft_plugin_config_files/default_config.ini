[Adaptive Potential Lines Parameters]
# AdaptiveAlgorithm descries the algorithm used for Adaptive Potential Lines. The PLs are modified in the vicinity of Humans, refered to as APL corridor. 
# The following breifly describes them:
# ConstantMargin: APL corridor is made at a fixed distance (i.e. parameter ConstantMargin) behind all human drivers.
# NSCM: Same as ConstantMargin, but the corridor is made only if the human is driving slower than its surrounding vehicles.
# NAM: APL corridor is formed if the human is leader of any CAV (by looking upto AdaptiveFollowerDistance behind human). APL corridor is only made upto the follower CAV instead of a fixed distance.
# FAM: Same as NAM but with additional condition that the human is driving slower than surrounding vehicles. 
# SVAM: Same as FAM but with additional condition that the follower CAV is also limited by the safe velocity.
# AM: If there is a follower CAV, then NAM is applied; otherwise, ConstantMargin is applied.
# PythonRL: This strategy uses Python RL code to determine the APL margin used for the creation of APL corridors. The margins are read from using the file given using PythonMarginInputFile parameter.
